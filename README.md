In this project I create a simple view that visualize a list of song that have a key word, for example if there is a key word "Happy" we can visualize in the view only songs with the key word "Happy".
And there is also the passage of the list from SwiftUI to UIKit  
I hope that this code will be useful, thanks to everyone 🫶🏻🫶🏻
